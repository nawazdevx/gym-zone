  <h1>GymZone – Modern Fitness & Gym Website</h1>

  <p>
    A professional fitness gym landing page template, <br />
    built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Fully responsive design for all devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> I started building HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects in 2022. <br />
    At that time, I focused on learning first and began uploading to GitHub recently. <br />
    Now I'm working with React.js and Next.js, and seeking opportunities as a frontend or web developer.
